Perennials are plants that come back year after year, while biennials take two growing seasons to complete their life cycle. Biennials do not flower the first year, but flower the second year, set seed, and then die.'

          p2: 'For example, lettuces and cabbages should be harvested when the head is large and still firm, but if you allow them to continue their growth cycle, the heads will open up and a tall flower stalk will grow.'

          p2: 'For example, planting marigoldsa around a garden helps repel garden pests while attracting pollinators.'
